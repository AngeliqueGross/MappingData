# MappingData

I mapped the number of hate crime incidents from the FBI in 2021 on a tile map where the size of the ellipses represent the number of incidents. 
The data was take from https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/explorer/crime/hate-crime and the most up to date. 
There was a sharp increase in hate crimes in 2021. It can be read about here https://www.themarshallproject.org/2023/03/25/asian-hate-crime-fbi-black-lgbtq
